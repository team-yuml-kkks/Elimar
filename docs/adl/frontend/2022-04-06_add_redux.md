# Add Redux and Redux Toolkit

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need a library to manage the state of the application.

## Decision

We chose [Redux]('https://redux.js.org/') because it is a library that is used to manage application state in React. Additionally, [Redux Toolkit]('https://redux-toolkit.js.org/') because it provides good defaults for configuring the store out of the box and includes built-in most commonly used Redux add-ons.

## Consequences

Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently. Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.

## Alternatives

[React Context]('https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html')
