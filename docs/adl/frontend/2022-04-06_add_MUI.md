# Add MUI

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need a library of components used to build applications whose front-end is based on React.js.

## Decision

We chose MUI because it allows programmers to develop a project in a faster and more structured way. MUI also has extensive and clear documentation, which greatly improves the user experience of the library.

## Consequences

MUI provides a robust, configurable, and accessible library of basic and advanced components to build a design system and develop React applications faster.

## Alternatives

Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind
