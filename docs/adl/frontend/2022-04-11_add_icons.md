# Add icons

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need icons that we will use in frontend views.

## Decision

We chose to use [icons]('https://mui.com/material-ui/icons/') from the MUI because they would be consistent with our look and easy to use.

## Consequences

Using MUI icons, we get Google Material icons packaged as a set of React components. These components use the MUI SvgIcon component to render an SVG path for each icon.

## Alternatives

[Font Awesome]('https://fontawesome.com/')
