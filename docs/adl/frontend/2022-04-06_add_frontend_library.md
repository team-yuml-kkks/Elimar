# Add react-ts

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need to choose a frontend framework to write an application quickly and efficiently.

## Decision

We chose the React framework ver. 18 along with Typescript support.

## Consequences

The reason we chose React + TS is to get the benefit of a statically typed language (TypeScript) for the user interface. This means more security and fewer errors sent to the frontend.

## Alternatives

Vue
