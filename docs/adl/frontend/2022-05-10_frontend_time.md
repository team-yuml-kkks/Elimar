**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need a library for dealing with dates in Javascript.

## Decision

We chose Luxon becouse we have some experience with this library. Temporal API is not ready for production right now and the current Date API is not the best

## Consequences

When Temporal API will be implemented that can be hard to move on it.

## Alternatives

Luxon, Date, Temporal

## Decision date
