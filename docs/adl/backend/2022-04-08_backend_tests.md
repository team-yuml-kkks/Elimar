# Using pytest

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context
* To create application with minimal bug we need to test our code.

## Decision

We decided to use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html).

## Consequences

We need to install additional library.

## Alternatives

We could use other framework like `Behave` for tests. But we would need to learn new library.
