# Badges architecture

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

* We need module to store badges
* The module should be very simple as there is not much bussiness logic.

## Decision

We decided to use 2-layered architecture for the `badges` module.

## Consequences

We will simplify the code but it will less testable.

## Alternatives

We could go for Hexagon architecture but it would be overhead in this case.
