# Use alembic for database migrations

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need add tool to handle migrations in SQLAlchemy

## Decision

We decided to use [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/).We used `Alembic` before and we have knowledge how to set it up. Moreover `Alembic` is recommended by `SQlAlchemy`.

## Consequences

We need to setup `Alembic`.

## Alternatives

We could use [Migra](https://pypi.org/project/migra/). But we never use it in development procecss.
