# Using strapi

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

* We need to deliver some functionality fast.
* Some functionality is CRUD like feature.

## Decision

We decided to use [strapi](https://strapi.io/). This will allow
us to deviler CRUD API faster then writing everything
ourselves. Furthermore, `strapi` is for free and our
team has some expierience working with it before.

## Consequences

Some problems with microservices will arise but
we will be able to deliver solution faster.

## Alternatives

* We could create everything ourselves.
* There is [prepr](https://prepr.io/) CMS but it is
costly and we have not expierience working with it.
