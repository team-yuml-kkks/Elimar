# JWT library

**Status:** _accepted_.

## Context

We need library or tool to parse JWT tokens.

## Decision

We've decided to use `python-jose` as JWT parsing library.
Main reason for is that all the examples from AWS are using this library.

## Consequences

We have to add new dependency to the project and learn how to use it.

## Alternatives

We could do everything by ourselves but it would take tremendous amount
of time. Alternatively we could use PyJWT, however we would need to
translate the examples from the AWS documentation.
